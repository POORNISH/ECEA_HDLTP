## CREATING A 2 BIT ADDER USING FOUR HALF ADDER :
**For a ***SINGLE BIT FULL ADDER*** to be executed the half adder module should be instantiated ***TWO*** times.**
**Similarly for a ***DOULBLE BIT FULL ADDER*** to be executed the half adder module should be instantiated ***FOUR*** times.**
**The process of instantiatiating modules and basic syntax for building a full adder were studied and implemented.**
## CREATING A TEST BENCH FILE :
**The various commands for building a test bench file 
( eg. initial , begin , $monitor $time ,$finish ) were studied and implemented.**
