#INSTALLATION : 
**vivado 2021.1 software was installed and basic uter interface was studied.
#RUNNING
**The test bench file for automatic error detection in our original code file is studied. 
**the test bench file is added to the simulation sources folder by using the the add sources option.
**the open elaborate design under the RTL ANALYSIS folder is used for verifing the blocks or circuital design of our hardware description language
**the simulated resultes can be obtained by using the run simulation command 
**thus the output wave forms for a full adder is obtained by using two half adders
**the output waveforms are produced with reference to the clock pulse input.
